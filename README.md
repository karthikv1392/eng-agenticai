# Engineering Agentic AI Systems
This repo consists of basic code snippets and examples for understanding the concepts behind engineering Agentic AI systems

## Getting started with the notebook 

1. The notebook Agentic_AI_Tutorial_Part1.ipynb has the complete code
2. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. The current deployment uses Google Gemini key. To get started with execution, you need to first get a Google API key
4. Generate Your API Key
      1. Go to Google AiStudio Api Key
      2. Generate Key.
      3. Provide any necessary permissions when prompted.
      4. Add Your API Key to Colab
      5. Open your Google Colab notebook.
      6. On the left panel, click the üîë ‚ÄúSecrets‚Äù icon.
      7. Click ‚Äú+ Add a new secret‚Äù.
      8. ‚ÄòName‚Äô is you key name, and ‚ÄòValue‚Äô is the key
      9. Configure the API Key in Your Code
      10. Change the name in the 3rd cell if needed: GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get(‚ÄòKey_Name‚Äô)
      11. Colab will ask for permission to access your secrets. Grant access to proceed.
5. Start running each cells (either run all or run one by one for better understanding)
